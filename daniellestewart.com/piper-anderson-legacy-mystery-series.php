						Tara Shiloh knows she’s not a drug addict. She’s positive she’s a good mother and hard worker. So why is she in an alley with a needle in her arm? Waking up in the hospital without her son is terrifying. Being told she can’t have him back nearly crushes her. With her memory spotty and the circumstances incriminating, Tara must fight to learn the truth and wrestle with the idea that maybe her son is better off without her.
					</p>
					<p>
						Reid Holliston defends guilty people for a living and it's slowly killing him. He’s certain there is no such thing as a truly blameless client anymore. When his phone rings with a voice from his childhood his jaded views make him certain Tara is just one more criminal claiming innocence. But even his skepticism isn’t enough to keep him away.
					</p>
					<p>
						Best friends from a lifetime ago, the two must find a way to trust each other again in spite of how the years apart have changed them. Can a promise made in childhood be enough to save them both?

						Every photograph was at one point a moment intended to be remembered. Ruby Constantine works tirelessly to give old film new life, salvaging forgotten and discarded rolls. There is a gamble to the process; she may end up with a priceless treasure or a stack of meaningless photographs. The job provides a level of excitement the rest of Ruby's life lacks. That is, until a particularly unique set turns out to have captured a grisly crime that Ruby knows the local police on Bolton Bluff Island off the coast of Maine are not equipped to solve.
					</p>
					<p>
						Patrick Sullivan has given up his job as an investigative reporter in Boston in order to write articles about bumble bees and pizza crusts for a tiny newspaper in Maine. Why? Because no one dies as a result of something he’s written anymore. Though his goal is to keep his head down and mind his own business, a call from Ruby changes everything. She holds a special place in his heart and helping is a pull he can’t resist. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Success seems impossible when their hunt for a killer becomes more dangerous than anything they could have imagined. Ruby and Patrick must decide if their lives are worth more than the truth.

						Would you ever go solo on a Caribbean cruise? Cosette certainly wouldn’t have considered it prior to her failed engagement. Suddenly single and looking to reset her life, she ventures out on what’s supposed to be an all-inclusive vacation, free of any worry. But the promise of safety is quickly snatched away when an emergency sends the ship into uncharted territory.
					</p>

					<p>
						Aiden had a plan. A dangerous, important responsibility that hinged on his cruise itinerary staying on track. When that falls apart, he’s faced with a split second choice that could jeopardize something much bigger than just his own life. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Luckily they’re joined by Edenville’s most infamous nosy (but kind-hearted) neighbors. Fellow passengers Michael, Jules, Betty and Clay cannot let the strangers at their dinner table face danger alone. But will the risk be too much when the truth comes out?
