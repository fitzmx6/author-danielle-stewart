						Autumn Chase is painfully aware grief is a beast that won’t be chased off before it’s ready to leave. When an icy road and a dark night leave her a young widow, she’s forced to trade in her perfectly planned future for the unknown. Like a child hiding from a monster, she pulls her covers up over her head with the intention of sheltering herself forever. But once an unexpected stranger shows up on her doorstep, Autumn has to choose between being alone or connecting with someone who is hurting as badly as she is.  
					</p>
					<p>
						Noah Key, an emergency room doctor, has solemnly informed countless families that their loved one could not be saved. However, when his own wife dies suddenly there are no words to bring him comfort. His in-laws want him to fall to pieces to confirm his love for his late wife. His colleagues want him to take time off to grieve. The only thing Noah wants is to work enough hours in the day to forget his wife is gone. He’s written himself a prescription for a cocktail of distraction and exhaustion in order to trick his brain into thinking his life isn’t in shambles.
					</p>
					<p>
						When the world keeps moving on without them, Noah and Autumn will need to decide if they’ll survive the storm or allow themselves to be swept away by it.

						For five years Jamie has managed to outrun his past, his pain, and anything remotely resembling an emotion. Now, with his probation over, he’s finally ready to leave town with plans to fade into the crowd and noise of Las Vegas. No more court-ordered grief counseling. No guardian trying to keep him out of trouble. He’s convinced all he needs is a blackjack table and a strong drink for the rest of his life. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Trixie believes she can tame the monster that keeps her tethered to Las Vegas. Her boyfriend, Eli, is difficult, but she can handle him. One night, however, her child’s in danger rather than herself, and she realizes running is the only chance they have to survive.
					</p>
					<p>
						Jamie offers safe passage out of town on one condition—Trixie cannot pry into his past. With every mile they drive, they grow closer. But the storm that chases them won’t relent, and somehow they must find a way to weather it together.

						Dr. Noah Key would gladly have traded places with his wife in the car accident that claimed her life. Without her he finds himself living a half life, haunted by all the ways he failed in his marriage.   
					</p>
					<p>
						Determined to absolve himself, Noah sets out on a journey to the other side of the world to provide medical aid after a devastating storm destroys an impoverished island. But nothing is as he expected; faced with impossibly difficult choices, Noah must decide if he’s helping or hurting the people around him.    
					</p>
					<p>
						Dr. Elizabeth Lowe has honed her skills by traveling to the most war torn and environmentally devastated regions of the world. Easily misjudged as cold and indifferent, Elizabeth seems like the last thing Noah needs in his life. But she may be the only person capable of convincing him to stop trying to pay a debt he doesn’t owe. Will he stop punishing himself long enough to realize he can let her in?
