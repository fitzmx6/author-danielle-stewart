				<strong>Ten Things to know about Danielle Stewart:</strong>
			</p>
                  <ul>
                        <li>
                              <strong>1.</strong> I have a fear of whales. All whales. The noise they make. The sight of them (even on tv). I don't think this phobia has a name and I've never met anyone else who feels this way. I blame it on the 3D movie when I was 7 at the Boston Museum of Science. (Thanks Dad.)
                        </li>

                        <li>
                              <strong>2.</strong> When I get hungry it brings out the worst in me. My friends and family know to keep me well fed. They pack snacks now.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                              <strong>3.</strong> I can cook but not bake. Not even a little. Not even a box of brownies.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                              <strong>4.</strong> If there is a song I like it is normal to hear me listening to it a hundred times (give or take) in a row.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                              <strong>5.</strong> I do not, under any circumstances, read directions. Who has time for that? Making mac & cheese by the seat of my pants for the last 25 years.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                              <strong>6.</strong> Like a black-out drunk, I have lost hours of my life mysteriously to Pinterest. If you haven't tried it yet... don't. Save your self. 
                        </li>

                        <li>
                              <strong>7.</strong> Before I became a mother, lots of things grossed me out. Now nothing does.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                              <strong>8.</strong> My favorite food is food... my least favorite food is no food. I love food. (apply the same rule to wine)
                        </li>

                        <li>
                              <strong>9.</strong> I do not have a green thumb. I have the kind of thumb that kills any type of plant ever given to me. Whatever kind of thumb that is... I have it.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                              <strong>10.</strong> Writing has changed my life. Not just the career it's created but the way I feel when I write. If you have something you love to do I hope you get the opportunity to do it.
