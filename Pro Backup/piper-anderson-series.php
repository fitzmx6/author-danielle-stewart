					<p>
						Piper Anderson has been given a fresh start in the picturesque town of Edenville, North Carolina. But her plans of settling into a normal life are derailed when she witnesses a prominent judge in her community committing a violent assault. Running from her own past and fueled by a passion to make the judge answer for his crimes, Piper is forced to decide if she’ll play by the rules or achieve justice in her own way.
					</p>
					<p>
						Complicating things further, Piper finds herself fighting a powerful attraction to rookie cop, Bobby Wright. Although she’s increasingly enamored with Bobby, his staunch belief in the justice system is in stark contrast to her own. She may not share his opinions about the effectiveness of the law, but she certainly can’t deny how safe she feels when she’s in his arms or how every kiss leaves her desperate for more.
					</p>
					<p>
						For Piper, the idea of finally living an ordinary life with a man to love is tempting. However, fate keeps placing the judge, quite literally, in her path. Will she decide the only way to win is to be as wicked as the judge, but with righteous intentions? And more importantly, will Bobby choose to let her go, or follow her as she crosses the line and takes justice into her own hands?

						Against all odds, Piper Anderson has managed to pick up the pieces of her life. She's holding tight to her budding romance with Officer Bobby Wright, anxious to have her moment with him. Now encircled by fiercely loyal friends, she finally feels like she's standing at the edge of a normal life. That is until reports of a brutal attack at the local college campus turn her dream of happily ever after into a nightmare. The unmistakably familiar details of the attack are an instant reminder of the chains tying her to people and places she so badly wants to escape.
					</p>
					<p>
						With her life and friends in danger, Piper must confront her past in order to fight for her future. To make matters worse, Piper and Bobby once again find their moral compasses pointing them in opposite directions. But what Piper doesn't know is that Bobby has secrets of his own. How can their love survive when their pasts have shaped them so differently? Piper's choices could bring her the freedom she yearns for, but will cutting ties with the past sever her relationship with Bobby?

					<p>
						All Chris wants is a normal Christmas. He’s spent his life dodging the police and trying to protect his son from the life he’s caught up in. He’s just returned from killing a killer and he swears it's his last act as a criminal. That is until his boss, the sexy blonde who is too uptight for her own good, ends up in a compromising position. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Sydney Collingsworth doesn't celebrate Christmas. She doesn't celebrate anything anymore. Unless you count a bottle of champagne every time she breaks up with another deadbeat boyfriend.
					</p>
					<p>
						Will these two opposites fall under the spell of the holidays long enough to realize they’re perfect for each other or will each of their pasts catch up with them before they get the chance?

						To Piper Anderson, fate has always been that unavoidable circumstance that befalls a person. Some people are destined to be happy, and others, like Piper, have a rougher road. Each time she tries to step off her predetermined path in search of happiness, someone or something drags her back to it. Heartbroken after Bobby allows his own past to come between them, Piper is eager to leave Edenville behind.
					</p>
					<p>
						With Jules as her companion, she heads back to New York, the place where it all began, in search of a piece of her history that isn't tarnished. Although finding the truth isn't nearly as difficult as Piper imagined it would be, she can't shake the feeling that what she has discovered may be too good to be true. Can Piper find what she is looking for and finally change her own fate?
